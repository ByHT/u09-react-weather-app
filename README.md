# u09-react-weather-app
Weather app, built in React. Group-assignment for Chas Academy.

In this assignment, you will create a React app to show the weather in your current location.

Requirements
As a user, you should be able to see:

temperature,
wind force,
humidity,
sunrise and sunset times
choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit
You should also be able to display a 5-day forecast, with temperature intervals of 3 hours

You should use a weather API such as SMHI, yr.no, OpenWeatherMaps, DarkSky, etc (your choice)

The design should be similar to common weather apps such as weather.com or Yahoo weather

Take advantage of geolocation in your browser

Extra Challenge
If you have the time and want to demonstrate deeper understanding of React, you can also add these features:

being able to manually search for the weather in a given location
Saving favourite places
display graphs of the temperature over time, with highest, lowest and average temperature
Grading
The grades are Icke Godkänt, Godkänt and Väl Godkänt

Principles for grading


In order to get the grade Godkänt it is necessary that the student can apply and develop simple solutions with React. The student should also be able to use external APIs in React with good competence.

To get the grade Väl Godkänt, you must:

In addition to the criteria for obtaining the grade, the student should be able to further develop his or her solution to the assignment, without further instructions from the instructor, and cover one or more of the various additional challenge requirements.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
